## Overview
Built a modular pipeline in Python for image classification. Focused on reliability and clean, production-style structure.

## Context & Role
- Internship @ Sunlux Technovations (6 months)
- Role: ML Engineer — owned design, implementation, and evaluation

## Problem
Raw images were noisy, off-center, and cluttered — models underperformed.

## Approach
1. **Preprocessing**: noise reduction, clutter removal, centering, edge detection → 90%+ input standardization accuracy.
2. **Feature engineering**: Zernike moments + statistical descriptors.
3. **Model**: probabilistic neural network (PNN); validated multiple feature vectors.
4. **Benchmarking**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 → selected best-performing config.

## Results
- Up to **97% test accuracy** across datasets.
- Faster iteration via modular components and consistent metrics.

## What I'd improve next
- Add data versioning and experiment tracking (DVC/MLflow).
- Convert to an exportable package + minimal CLI.
